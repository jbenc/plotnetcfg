plotnetcfg is a tool that scans networking configuration on the machine and
plots a diagram of the configuration hierarchy.

Design goals are:
1. Lighweight. It should have no run time dependencies. Just scp the
   binary to the target machine.
2. Works across net namespaces.
3. Allows multiple frontends (graphviz and json frontends are currently
   supported).


Example usage:

ssh target_machine plotnetcfg | dot -Tpdf > output.pdf


Building:

Jansson library is required, version 2.3 or newer:
http://www.digip.org/jansson/

To statically link against Jansson, build the Jansson library and invoke in
the plotnetcfg source directory:

make jansson=/path/to/jansson

To dynamically link against Jansson, ensure Jansson is properly installed in
the system (e.g. using the devel package provided by your distribution) and
invoke:

make
